# Supply Chain Management on Blockchain

## Description
This project is a simple, educational skeleton that demonstrates a decentralized supply chain management system using blockchain technology. It is designed to provide a foundational understanding of how products can be tracked transparently and securely from production to delivery using smart contracts.

## Features
- Smart contracts for creating and managing items within the supply chain.
- Ability to add logistical steps to each item's journey.
- Functionality to mark items as shipped, finalizing their supply chain progress.
- A frontend interface for interacting with the supply chain (not included in this skeleton).

## Technology Stack
- **Ethereum**: For deploying smart contracts.
- **Solidity**: Programming language for writing smart contracts.
- **Truffle Suite**: For developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
- **React**: Recommended for building the frontend application (if needed).
- **Web3.js**: Library to interact with Ethereum nodes from web applications.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Truffle Suite
- Ganache (for local blockchain simulation)

### Installing
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd supply-chain-on-blockchain
   npm install
   ```
3. Start Ganache and deploy the contracts:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate --reset
   ```
4. Run the frontend application:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
The project can be used to learn the basics of implementing a supply chain on blockchain. It includes basic operations such as item creation, adding steps to an item's supply chain, and marking an item as shipped. For usage details, please refer to the comments in the smart contract code.

## Contributing
This project is intended as a starting point for learning and development. Contributions aimed at enhancing the educational value or extending the functionality are highly welcome. Please fork the repository and open a pull request with your additions.
